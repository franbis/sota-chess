# SotA Chess

*SotA Chess* is a chess game where almost any move the AI makes is valid.
<br>
Who needs rules anyway? 😏

### Why?

The current *"state of the art"* in the AI scene is AIs that, sometime, make mistakes that go against a defined set of rules.
<br>
In some contexts, we can't afford to allow the AI to break those rules. These include a game of chess, for example.

Sometimes these mistakes are pretty funny tho, hence why this project was created.
